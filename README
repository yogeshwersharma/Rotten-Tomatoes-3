## Rotten Tomatoes

This is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using the
[Rotten Tomatoes API](http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs/read/JSON).

Time spent: 10-12 hours

### Features

#### Required

- [x] User can view a list of movies. Poster images load asynchronously.
- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [ ] User sees loading state while waiting for the API.
    - Did not get to do this. 
- [ ] User sees error message when there is a network error:
  http://cl.ly/image/1l1L3M460c3C
    - Did not get to do this either. 
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.
    - Did this, but the the callback for refresh control is not firing.

#### Optional

- [ ] All images fade in.
- [ ] For the larger poster, load the low-res first and switch to high-res when
  complete.
- [ ] All images should be cached in memory and disk: AppDelegate has an
  instance of `NSURLCache` and `NSURLRequest` makes a request with
  `NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad` cache policy. I tested it by turning
  off wifi and restarting the app.
- [ ] Customize the highlight and selection effect of the cell.
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Add a tab bar for Box Office and DVD.
- [ ] Add a search bar: pretty simple implementation of searching against the
  existing table view data.
